# In Japan, there is a saying, "When the autumn rains fall, the cat's face becomes three feet long.
# This means that the cat's face is longer and more joyful on rainy days than on sunny days in autumn, because the temperature is higher on rainy days.
# We assume that the more it rains, the more pleased the cat will be.
# Of course, this is limited to autumn.
# If it is autumn now, this will help.
# There is a lot going on in the world right now.
# But it does not matter to cats.
# If cats are happy, the world will be peaceful.
